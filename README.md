# Pixel Sort Masked – ComfyUI Node

Custom **ComfyUI** node that applies **pixel sorting effects constrained by a mask**.

Instead of sorting the entire image, this node limits the effect to specific regions, allowing controlled glitch, distortion, and data-moshing–style aesthetics without destroying the full composition.

## Features

- Pixel sorting restricted to a mask
- Sorting based on luminance / intensity (depending on implementation)
- Preserves untouched areas of the image
- Useful for glitch art, experimental stylization, and visual research
